# General Web & Dev, Etc. Questions 

* Explain MVC architecture

* What is HTTP?

* Explain truthiness and falsiness, pick your language. 
  * The adjectives "truthy" and "falsey" are a programming convention for describing the state of being true and the state of being false.
  What this example amounts to is this: we want to be able to use non-boolean values (like strings or integers) in a boolean context; we want to be able to say, "if a certain statement evaluates to true (or is "truthy"), then execute these certain lines of code."
  Consequently, Ruby must have a way of determining what counts as true at a given momentâ€”or what is "truthy" versus what is "falsey".[Sourced from Learn](https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development/intro-to-ruby-development/logic-and-conditions/truthiness).
